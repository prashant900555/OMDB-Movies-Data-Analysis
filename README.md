# OMDB-Movies-Data-Analysis
I chose the Open Movie Database (OMDB), because it is one of the best movie api's available, which not only has information about a particular movie, but also has several international online ratings along with the awards won and other informational columns like the runtime, boxoffice collection, and so on; using which I'll be able to analyse the data and infer relative information from it about the cinema industry around the globe.
